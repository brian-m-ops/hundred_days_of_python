# Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge
# of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen (think of it as a safe zone
# for our little turtle). Hint: generate a new car only every 6th time the game loop runs. If you get stuck,
# check the video walkthrough in Step 4.
